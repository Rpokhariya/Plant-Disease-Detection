## Plant  Disease Detection

### üìñ Project Description

This project is an intelligent image classification system engineered to accurately diagnose **39 distinct types of plant diseases** directly from leaf images. The core of this system is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, a deep learning model meticulously trained to achieve **86% accuracy** on the validation set.

To make this powerful diagnostic tool accessible and easy to use, an interactive web application was developed using **Streamlit**. This application allows users to simply upload an image of a plant leaf and receive an instant diagnosis. A built-in preprocessing tool automatically prepares the uploaded image, ensuring it is in the optimal format for the model's analysis.
